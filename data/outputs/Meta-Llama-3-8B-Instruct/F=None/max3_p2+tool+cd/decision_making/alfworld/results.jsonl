Will it help you achieve your goal, or will it lead to a dead end?\n3. **Use the available tools**: Familiarize yourself with the available tools and use them to your advantage. In this game, the tools are the functions like `goto`, `take_from`, `put`, etc.\n4. **Think ahead**: Try to anticipate what might happen if you take a certain action. Will you need to undo something later on?\n5. **Don't be afraid to try again**: If your initial solution doesn't work, don't be discouraged. Try again, and think about what you could do differently.\n\nAs for strategies, here are a few that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Start with a simple goal**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable goals. This will make it easier to focus on one thing at a time.\n2. **Use a \"plan and execute\" approach**: Think about what you want to achieve, and then execute your plan step by step.\n3. **Keep track of your progress**: As you solve the task, keep track of what you've done and what you still need to do.
