I can start by considering the first element of the sequence, which can be any number from 1 to m. Then, for each subsequent element, I can choose a number that is at least twice the previous element and at most m. This means that for each element, I have m/2 + 1 possible choices. Since there are n elements in the sequence, the total number of possible sequences is the product of the number of choices for each element. However, this product will be overcounting, since the same sequence can be generated in multiple ways. For example, the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8 can also be generated as 2, 4, 8, 1. To avoid this overcounting, I need to divide the total number of possible sequences by n!.

Since the sum of the sides is given, we can assume that the sides are a, a, and b, where a + a + b = sum. The volume of the cuboid is a * a * b. We need to maximize this volume. Since a and a are equal, we can substitute a with b/2. Then, the volume becomes (b/2) * (b/2) * b = b^3/4. We need to maximize this volume. The maximum value of b^3/4 is when b is maximum. Since b is a part of the sum, we can find the maximum value of b by subtracting the maximum value of a from the sum. The maximum value of a is half of the sum, so the maximum value of b is the sum - a = sum - sum/2 = sum/2. Now, we can substitute b with sum/2 in the volume equation.
