Suppose that there are enough buyers relative to sellers that competition among them leads cars to be sold at their maximum willingness to pay. What would the market equilibrium price for good cars be if sellers value good cars at $6,000? Output format required: integer\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought> To solve this problem, we need to find the market equilibrium price for good cars. Since there are 50 good cars and each is worth $10,000 to a buyer, the total value of good cars is $500,000. However, sellers value good cars at $6,000 each, so the total value of good cars to sellers is $300,000. To find the market equilibrium price, we need to find the price at which the total value of good cars to buyers equals the total value of good cars to sellers. Let's call this price x. The total value of good cars to buyers is 50 * 10,000 = 500,000, and the total value of good cars to sellers is 50 * x.
