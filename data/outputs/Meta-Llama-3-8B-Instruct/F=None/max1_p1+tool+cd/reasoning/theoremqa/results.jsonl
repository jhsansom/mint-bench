The derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\log f_\\theta(x) = -\\frac{1}{2\\theta} + \\frac{x^2}{\\theta^2}$. The Fisher information is then given by $I(\\theta) = E\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\log f_\\theta(x)\\right)^2\\right] = E\\left[\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\theta} + \\frac{x^2}{\\theta^2}\\right)^2\\right]$. Since $x$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\\theta$, we have $E[x^2] = \\theta$. Substituting this into the expression for the Fisher information, we get $I(\\theta) = E\\left[\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\theta} + \\frac{\\theta}{\\theta^2}\\right)^2\\right] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{4\\theta^2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{4\\theta^2}$.
