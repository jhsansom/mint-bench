Although the term may not be used, the concept is also used in roof design and landscape architecture.\nIf the drainage gradient is too low, rain and melt water drainage will be insufficient.

The assistant should also remember that the angle of the banked curve and the speed of the car are related through the equation $tan(\\theta) = \\frac{v^2}{rg}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of the banked curve, $v$ is the speed of the car, $r$ is the radius of the curve, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The assistant should use this equation to find the angle of the banked curve for a speed of 20 m/s, and then use this angle to find the minimum coefficient of static friction needed for a speed of 30 m/s.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 1, "invalid_action": 3}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 8782, "total_tokens": 10376, "completion_tokens": 1594, "feedback_prompt_tokens": 8930, "feedback_completion_tokens": 775, "feedback_total_tokens": 9705}, "terminate_reason": "error", "error": "InvalidRequestError\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 403, in handle_error_response\n    error_data = resp[\"error\"]\nKeyError: 'error'\n\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/interact_eval/src/agents/vllm_agent.py\", line 74, in call_lm\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_resources/completion.py\", line 25, in create\n    return super().create(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_resources/abstract/engine_api_resource.py\", line 153, in create\n    response, _, api_key = requestor.request(\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 298, in request\n    resp, got_stream = self._interpret_response(result, stream)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 700, in _interpret_response\n    self._interpret_response_line(\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 763, in _interpret_response_line\n    raise self.handle_error_response(\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 405, in handle_error_response\n    raise error.APIError(\nopenai.error.APIError: Invalid response object from API: '{\"object\":\"error\",\"message\":\"This model\\'s maximum context length is 4096 tokens.

Although the term \"escape velocity\" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction. The escape speed is independent of the mass of the escaping object, but increases with the mass of the primary body; it decreases with the distance from the primary body, thus taking into account how far the object has already traveled. Its calculation at a given distance means that no acceleration is further needed for the object to escape: it will slow down as it travels\u2014due to the massive body's gravity\u2014but it will never quite slow to a stop.

The entropy rate of a random walk on a graph is not calculated by simply taking the logarithm of the number of edges. The entropy rate of a random walk on a graph is given by the entropy of the stationary distribution of the walk. The stationary distribution is the probability distribution to which the random walk converges in the long run. For a connected graph, the stationary distribution is uniform, meaning each node is equally likely to be visited. Therefore, the entropy rate is the logarithm of the number of nodes, not edges.

For example, the Rutherford cross-section is a measure of probability that an alpha particle will be deflected by a given angle during an interaction with an atomic nucleus. Cross section is typically denoted \u03c3 (sigma) and is expressed in units of area, more specifically in barns. In a way, it can be thought of as the size of the object that the excitation must hit in order for the process to occur, but more exactly, it is a parameter of a stochastic process.\nIn classical physics, this probability often converges to a deterministic proportion of excitation energy involved in the process, so that, for example, with light scattering off of a particle, the cross section specifies the a\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.

Wavelength is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves, as well as other spatial wave patterns. The inverse of the wavelength is called the spatial frequency. Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb).\nThe term \"wavelength\" is also sometimes applied to modulated waves, and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids.Assuming a sinusoidal wave moving at a fixed wave speed, wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave: waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.Wavelength depends on the m\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is NOT GOOD.

It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.\nGold often occurs in free elemental (native state), as nuggets or grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as in electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium, and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).\nGold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion.

One for which the probability is not 1/2 is called a biased or unfair coin. In theoretical studies, the assumption that a coin is fair is often made by referring to an ideal coin.\nJohn Edmund Kerrich performed experiments in coin flipping and found that a coin made from a wooden disk about the size of a crown and coated on one side with lead landed heads (wooden side up) 679 times out of 1000.  In this experiment the coin was tossed by balancing it on the forefinger, flipping it using the thumb so that it spun through the air for about a foot before landing on a flat cloth spread over a table.

This corresponds to the standard economic view of a consumer reservation price. Some researchers, however, conceptualize WTP as a range.\nAccording to the constructed preference view, consumer willingness to pay is a context-sensitive construct; that is, a consumer's WTP for a product depends on the concrete decision context. For example, consumers tend to be willing to pay more for a soft drink in a luxury hotel resort in comparison to a beach bar or a local retail store.\n\nPage: Hedonic damages\nSummary: Hedonic damages is a legal term that first emerged in 1985 in the research of Stan V.

A thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.\nThis effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is affected by the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.\nThe term \"thermoelectric effect\" encompasses three separately identified effects: the Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect.

The map is thereby conformal. As a side effect, the Mercator projection inflates the size of objects away from the equator.
