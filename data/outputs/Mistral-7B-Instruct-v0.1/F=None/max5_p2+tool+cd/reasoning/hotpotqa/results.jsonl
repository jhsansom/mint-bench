Robert Cargill, who both produced with Jason Blum. It is an adaptation of the 2004 short story of the same name by Joe Hill. The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke. In the film, an abducted teenager (Thames) uses a mysterious telephone to communicate with the previous victims of his deranged captor (Hawke).\nDerrickson came on board to direct The Black Phone after departing Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness over creative differences.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Assistant:\n<thought> From the wiki_search results, we can see that Scott Derrickson is an American filmmaker, while Ed Wood was an American filmmaker, actor, and pulp novel author. </thought>\n<execute>\nprint(\"Scott Derrickson is American\")\nprint(\"Ed Wood is American\")\n</execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nScott Derrickson is American\nEd Wood is American\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "  Assistant:\n<thought> Since both Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are American, they are of the same nationality. </thought>\n<execute>\nprint(\"Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are of the same nationality\")\n</execute>\n \nThe answer is <solution> Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are of the same nationality </solution>.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nYour answer is wrong.\nYou have 2 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "  Assistant:\n<thought> I apologize for the mistake in my previous response.

He and his friend Du Fu (712\u2013770) were two of the most prominent figures in the flourishing of Chinese poetry under the Tang dynasty, which is often called the \"Golden Age of Chinese Poetry\".

His poems have been collected into the most important Tang dynasty collection, Heyaue yingling ji, compiled in 753 by Yin Fan. Thirty-four of Li Bai's poems are included in the anthology Three Hundred Tang Poems, which was first published in the 18th century. Around the same time, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe.

Filmed in Technicolor, it was directed by Mitchell Leisen. The musical score was by Victor Young, who incorporated the main theme of French composer Claude Debussy's Clair de Lune as the love theme for the film.\nThe film is a mostly faithful adaptation of the novel, taking place during the reign of Charles II in the mid-17th century, mostly in the Cornish region of England.Fontaine was under contract to independent producer to David O. Selznick, who loaned out his contract players to other studios. In this case, Fontaine was loaned to Paramount for this lavish production.
