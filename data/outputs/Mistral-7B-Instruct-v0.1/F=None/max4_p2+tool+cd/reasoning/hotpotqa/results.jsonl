The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Assistant:\n<thought> From the wiki_search results, we can see that Scott Derrickson is an American filmmaker, while Ed Wood was an American filmmaker, actor, and pulp novel author. </thought>\n<execute>\nprint(\"Scott Derrickson is American\")\nprint(\"Ed Wood is American\")\n</execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nScott Derrickson is American\nEd Wood is American\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "  Assistant:\n<thought> Since both Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are American, they are of the same nationality. </thought>\n<execute>\nprint(\"Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are of the same nationality.\")\n</execute>\n\nThe answer is <solution> Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are of the same nationality. </solution>.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nYour answer is wrong.\nYou have 1 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "  Assistant:\n<thought> I apologize for the mistake in my previous response.
