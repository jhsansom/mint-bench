Beginning in August 1942, four vessels, Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, were completed; two more, Illinois and Kentucky, were laid down but canceled in 1945 and 1958, respectively, before completion, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958\u20131959.\nThe four Iowa-class ships were the last battleships commissioned in the U.S. Navy.

The question is asking about an ethnic group that settled in Canada in the 17th century and participated in a conflict with Irish Catholic immigrants during the Shiners' War. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about the Shiners' War. From what I remember, the Shiners' War was a conflict in the early 18th century, specifically around 1720-1730, involving French-Canadian settlers and Irish Catholic immigrants. The Irish immigrants were part of a group called the \"Shiners,\" which I think refers to the Irish Catholics who came to Canada, possibly in the area of what is now New Brunswick. The conflict was over land and resources.\n\nNow, the question mentions an ethnic group that settled in Canada in the 17th century. The 17th century is from 1601 to 1700. The French started settling in Canada in the early 17th century, with the establishment of Quebec City in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain. So the French were there in the 17th century. The Irish immigrants came later, in the early 18th century, which would be the 1700s. \n\nWait, the Shiners' War is mentioned here. Let me check if the French-Canadians were involved in that conflict. The French-Canadians, also known as Canadiens, were the original settlers in the region. The Irish Catholics, or the Shiner immigrants, came later and had conflicts with the existing French-Canadian population. \n\nSo the ethnic group that settled in Canada in the 17th century would be the French. The conflict with the Irish Catholics in the Shiners' War would be between the French-Canadians and the Irish immigrants. Therefore, the answer is likely the French. \n\nBut I should verify this.

The user is asking about an ethnic group that settled in Canada in the 17th century and participated in a conflict with Irish Catholic immigrants during the Shiners' War. \n\nFirst, I need to recall or find information about the Shiners' War. From what I remember, the Shiners' War was a conflict in the early 18th century, specifically the 1720s, involving French-Canadian settlers and Irish Catholics. The term \"Shiners\" might refer to a group of French-Canadian fur traders or settlers. The conflict was likely over land or resources.\n\nSince the user mentioned the 17th century, but the Shiners' War is in the early 18th century, there might be a slight discrepancy. However, the main point is the ethnic group involved. The French-Canadian settlers, also known as Canadiens, were prominent in that region. They might have been the ones conflicting with the Irish Catholics. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"Shiners\" refers to a specific group. I should verify this. Using the Wikipedia search tool could help. Let me check the Shiners' War entry. \n\nWait, the user's previous interaction used the wikipedia_search function. Let me try that.

If the search isn't available, maybe I can infer based on historical context. \n\nAssuming that the French-Canadian settlers were the ones in conflict with Irish Catholics, the answer would be the French or Canadiens. However, I need to be precise. Another possibility is the Acadians, but they were more involved in the 1750s. Alternatively, the term \"Shiners\" might refer to a specific group like the French-Canadian fur traders. \n\nGiven the information I have, the most likely answer is the French-Canadian settlers, but I should confirm.

The question is about an ethnic group in 17th-century Canada that fought in the Shiners' War against Irish Catholic immigrants. I remember that the Shiners' War, also known as the \"Shiner's War\" or \"The War of the Shiner,\" took place in the 1720s in what is now Ontario, Canada. \n\nFrom what I recall, the conflict was between French-Canadian settlers and Irish Catholics. The French-Canadians were primarily of French descent, having settled in the region earlier, while the Irish Catholics were immigrants who came later, possibly during the 17th or early 18th century. The French-Canadians were part of the larger French population in New France, which included areas that are now Quebec and Ontario.\n\nWait, but the user previously tried \"French-Canadian\" and it was marked wrong. Maybe the correct term is different. Let me think again. The term \"Shiners\" refers to a group of French-Canadian settlers who were involved in the conflict. However, the ethnic group they were conflicting with were the Irish Catholics. So the answer might be \"French-Canadian\" but perhaps the correct term is \"Acadians\"? No, Acadians were from Nova Scotia and later became the Cajuns in Louisiana. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"British\" but that doesn't fit because the French-Canadians were part of New France, which was under French rule. The Irish Catholics might have been part of the British colonies, leading to conflict between French and British settlers. Wait, but the question specifies the ethnic group in Canada. The French-Canadians were the primary settlers in the region. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is \"French\" instead of \"French-Canadian\"? Or maybe \"Huron\" or another Indigenous group? No, the conflict was between European settlers. The Irish Catholics were immigrants, so the opposing group would be the existing French-Canadian settlers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"Cajuns,\" but they are a subset of French-Canadians. The user's initial answer was \"French-Canadian,\" which was marked wrong. Maybe the correct answer is \"French\" or \"Acadians.\" Wait, but Acadians were in Nova Scotia. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"Irish,\" but the question says the conflict was with Irish Catholics, so the other group is French-Canadian.

From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin.

The titular Johnny Bravo (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who is loosely based on Elvis Presley and James Dean, is a blonde-haired sunglasses-wearing, muscular, and dimwitted young man who lives with his mother and attempts to get women to date him, though he always falls short because of his actions. He ends up in bizarre situations and predicaments, often accompanied by celebrity guest characters such as Donny Osmond or Adam West. Throughout its run, the show was known for its adult humor and pop culture references.\nPartible pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera's animation showcase What a Cartoon!, basing it on his senior thesis project he produced while attending Loyola Marymount University.

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan was decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court. Let me start by recalling what I know about these cases.\n\nFirst, Berghuis v. Thompkins. I remember that this case was about the Fifth Amendment and self-incrimination. The key point was whether a suspect must explicitly invoke their right to remain silent. The Supreme Court ruled that a suspect must clearly and unambiguously assert their right to remain silent for it to be considered an invocation. The decision was in 2010. Now, I need to check the vote count. I think it was a 5-4 decision, but I'm not entirely sure. \n\nThen there's Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan. This case was about gender discrimination in education. The Court ruled that the state's law excluding men from a nursing program was unconstitutional. The decision was in 1982. I believe this was also a 5-4 decision. Wait, but I need to confirm which one of these was decided 5-4. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the votes. Let me think again. Berghuis v. Thompkins was a 5-4 decision with the majority being the conservative justices. On the other hand, Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan was a 5-4 decision as well, but the majority was the liberal justices. Wait, but the question is asking which one was decided 5-4. Both cases were 5-4? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about one of them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of them was decided with a different split. Let me try to recall. Berghuis v. Thompkins was a 5-4 decision.
