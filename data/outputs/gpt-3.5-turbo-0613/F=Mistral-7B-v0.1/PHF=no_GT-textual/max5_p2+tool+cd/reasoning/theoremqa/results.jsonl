Since the graph is small and does not have weighted edges, we can use BFS to find the shortest path.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 using BFS:\n\n1. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph:\n   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n   - Node 1 is connected to node 0.\n   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.\n   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.\n   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.\n   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.\n\n2.

If node 5 is not in the parent dictionary, there is no path from node 0 to node 5. Return False.\n7. Otherwise, construct the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 using the parent dictionary:\n   - Start from node 5 and traverse back to node 0 using the parent dictionary.\n   - Append each node to a list.\n   - Reverse the list to get the correct order of nodes.\n8.
