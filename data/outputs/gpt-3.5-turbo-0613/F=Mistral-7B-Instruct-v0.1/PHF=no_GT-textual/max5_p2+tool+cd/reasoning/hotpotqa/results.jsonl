Reality television shows tend to be interspersed with \"confessionals\", short interview segments in which cast members reflect on or provide context for the events being depicted on-screen; this is most commonly seen in American reality television.

Not all newspapers associated with tabloid journalism are tabloid size, and not all tabloid-size newspapers engage in tabloid journalism; in particular, since around the year 2000 many broadsheet newspapers converted to the more compact tabloid format.In some cases, celebrities have successfully sued for libel, demonstrating that tabloid stories have defamed them.
