You made a mistake in your calculations. You tried to calculate the normal force without having a value for the mass of the automobile.

The net acceleration of the car is the difference between the centripetal acceleration at 30 m/s and the component of gravity that acts in the horizontal direction. The component of gravity that acts in the horizontal direction can be calculated using the equation $g * sin(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the banking angle of the road. The banking angle can be calculated using the equation $\\theta = arctan(\\frac{v^2}{g*r})$, where $v$ is the speed for which the curve is banked correctly, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $r$ is the radius of the curve. After calculating the net acceleration, you can calculate the minimum coefficient of static friction using the equation $\\mu_{s_{min}} = \\frac{F_{net}}{m * g}$.
