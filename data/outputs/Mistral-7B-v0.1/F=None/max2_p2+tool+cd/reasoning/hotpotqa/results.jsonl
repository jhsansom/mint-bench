From 1995 to 2011, he served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Rhode Island's 1st congressional district.  He is a former member of the President's Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, and co-founder of One Mind.\nBorn and raised in Boston, he is the youngest child and second son of the long-time Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, and is a nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Providence College.

The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.The Court was split, 5\u20134.
