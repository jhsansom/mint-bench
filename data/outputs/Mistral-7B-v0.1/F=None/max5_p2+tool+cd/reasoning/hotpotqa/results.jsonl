The regulations governing the cars are unique to the championship and specify that cars must be constructed by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be outsourced. Formula One cars are the fastest cars in the world around a race track, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Due to the amount of braking force and the total cornering envelope of a Formula One car (by the friction component of the tyre, the mass of the machine and the downforce generated), Formula One drivers experience frequent lateral g-loadings in excess of five g and peak cornering forces of up to seven lateral g.\n\nPage: List of female Formula One drivers\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "  Assistant:\n\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Formula One cars are the fastest cars in the world around a race track.\nLet's search for information about female Formula One drivers.\n</thought>\n<execute> print(wikipedia_search('List of female Formula One drivers')) </execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nPage: List of female Formula One drivers\nSummary: This is a list of female motor racing drivers who have taken part in the Formula One World Championship since the inception of the World Championship for Drivers in 1950.\nFive women racing drivers have entered at least one Grand Prix, although only two of them ever qualified and started a race.

Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.The Court was split, 5\u20134.
