The equilibrium quantity can be found by setting the area of the triangle equal to zero and solving for Q.\n\nThe equilibrium price is 53 - 5 = 48, and the equilibrium quantity is 53 - 48 = 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the marginal cost curve. The marginal cost curve is given by the firm's production function, which is Q = a - b*Q. In this case, the production function is Q = 53 - b*Q, where b is the constant marginal cost.\n\nThe equilibrium price and quantity are 48 and 5, respectively. Substituting these values into the production function, we get Q = 53 - b(53 - 48) = 53 - 5*5 = 53 - 25 = 28. Therefore, the marginal cost at the equilibrium quantity is 28.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the triangle between the demand curve and the marginal cost curve. The area of the triangle is (1/2)*b*(Q - 5), where b is the marginal cost at the equilibrium quantity. Substituting the equilibrium quantity of 5 into this formula, we get (1/2)*28*(5 - 5) = 14.\n\nTherefore, the consumer surplus obtained by consumers under perfect competition is 14.

To do this, we will show that the sequence has a finite moment generating function (MGF). The MGF of a random variable X is defined as $\\phi(t)=E(e^{tX})$ and is a measure of the moments of X.\n\nSince each $X\\_i$ has a uniform distribution on the interval $(-n/2, n/2)$, we have $\\phi(t)=1+nt/2+O(t^2)$. Therefore, the MGF of the sequence $n^{-1}\\sum\\_{i=2}^n X\\_i$ is $\\phi(t)=1+nt/2+O(t^2)$.\n\nNow, we will show that the MGF converges for $t\\to 0$. Since $P(X\\_i\\in[-n/2, n/2])=1$ for all $i$, we have $\\phi(0)=1$. Moreover, for any $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\phi'(t)=n/2$. Therefore, $\\phi(t)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $t$. Hence, by the monotone convergence theorem, $\\phi(t)$ converges for $t\\to 0$.\n\nSince the MGF converges for $t\\to 0$, we can use the moment-generating function test to determine the convergence of the sequence in almost surety.

Therefore, the sum $n^{-1}\\sum\\_{i=2}^n X\\_i$ is the sum of $n$ independent random variables, each with probability $1$ of being in the interval $(-n/2, n/2)$.
