The Iowa class was designed to meet the Second London Naval Treaty's \"escalator clause\" limit of 45,000-long-ton (45,700 t) standard displacement. Four vessels, Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, were completed; two more, Illinois and Kentucky, were laid down but canceled in 1945 and 1958, respectively, before completion, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958\u20131959.\nThe four Iowa-class ships were the last battleships commissioned in the US Navy.

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, I will first provide a brief summary of both cases.\n\nBerghuis v. Thompkins:\nIn this case, the Supreme Court held that a police officer's stop of a driver for a traffic violation is not a \"seizure\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court ruled that the officer's action was a \"Terry frisk,\" which is a limited search of outer clothing for weapons, and is allowed under the Fourth Amendment as long as it is reasonable.\n\nMississippi University for Women v. Hogan:\nIn this case, the Supreme Court held that a state law school that is open to both men and women is not violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court ruled that the school's policy of allowing only women to attend the school does not constitute \"separate but equal\" treatment, as it is not intended to be permanent and is instead a temporary measure until the school can become co-ed.\n\nNow, I will determine which case was decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court by looking at the vote count. A majority vote of 5-4 is enough to decide a case, and in this case, it is necessary to determine which case had more votes.\n\nTo do this, I will first find the number of votes cast for each case. In the Supreme Court, each justice votes either \"Aye\" or \"Nay\" on a case, and the total number of votes is the sum of the votes cast by all the justices. Therefore, I will first find the number of votes cast for Berghuis v. Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan.\n\nAfter finding the number of votes cast for each case, I will compare the votes and determine which case had more votes.
