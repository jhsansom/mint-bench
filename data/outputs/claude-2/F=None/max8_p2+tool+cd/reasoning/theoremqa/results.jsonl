The key is that with compass and straightedge, one can only construct lengths that are constructible numbers. According to the ancient Greek mathematicians, constructible numbers can be generated starting from 1 using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.\n\nFor each value of X, I will check if X^(1/3) is a constructible number. If so, the edge length can be constructed and the answer is 1.

This means X^(1/3) needs to be a constructible number in order for the new edge length to be constructible.\n\nAfter reviewing properties of constructible numbers again, I realize that X itself needs to be a perfect cube for X^(1/3) to be constructible. \n\nSo for each X, the answer should be 1 if X is a perfect cube, and 0 otherwise.\n</thought>\n\nThe answer is <solution>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]</solution>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": null, "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nYour answer is wrong.\nYou have 7 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 2, "use_tool": 0, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {}, "terminate_reason": "max_propose_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 44, "prompt": "Answer the following question with a number, a list of numbers or True or False.
