Since the volume of a cube is proportional to the cube of its edge length, this is equivalent to asking if we can construct the cube root of X using only compass and straightedge. According to the ancient Greek mathematicians, cube roots of 2 and 3 are constructible, but in general cube roots are not constructible using only compass and straightedge.
