So the mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time.\n\nThe dependence between adjacent n-blocks refers to the statistical dependence between n consecutive blocks or samples from the process. If the process is stationary, then this dependence should only depend on the gap between the blocks, not on their absolute time.\n\nThe question states that the dependence grows linearly with n. This means that if you look at blocks of size n, the dependence between adjacent blocks is proportional to n. \n\nFor a stationary process, the dependence actually does not grow with n. The dependence only depends on the gap between blocks, not the block size n. So the dependence does not grow linearly with n.\n\nTherefore, the statement is False.\n</thought>\n\nThe answer is <solution>False</solution>.\n"}], "finished": true, "success": true, "latest_output": {"content": "You are a helpful assistant assigned with the task of problem-solving.
