The face value is the amount borrowed by the borrower and is repaid to the lender at the end of the bond's maturity period. The face value is given by the product of the principal and the coupon rate. The coupon rate is the annual interest rate paid on the bond's face value. In this case, the coupon rate is 8%/year. The principal is the face value of the bond. Since the bond has 18 years to maturity, the principal is given by the product of the face value and the number of years to maturity. Let's assume the face value is $F. Then, the principal is $F \\* 18. The coupon payment is the product of the principal and the coupon rate, which is $F \\* 18 \\* 0.08. The yield is the rate of return on the bond, which is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond's future cash flows to its current market price. In this case, the yield is 9%/year. The bond's price is the present value of its future cash flows, which is the sum of the present value of each coupon payment and the present value of the face value at maturity. The present value of each coupon payment is the coupon payment divided by (1 + yield)^t, where t is the time in years until the coupon payment is made.

Let me provide the solution to the problem. The price of the bond can be calculated using the present value of the future cash flows. The present value of each coupon payment is given by the formula: C/(1+y)^t, where C is the coupon payment, y is the yield, and t is the time in years until the coupon payment is made. The present value of the face value at maturity is given by the formula: F/(1+y)^n, where F is the face value and n is the number of years to maturity. Therefore, the price of the bond is the sum of the present value of each coupon payment and the present value of the face value at maturity. Using the given values, we have: C = 8% \\* F \\* 18 = 0.144F, y = 9%, t = 1 to 18, n = 18, and F = $1000 (assuming the face value is $1000).

The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. The algorithm starts by choosing a maximum and minimum value in the interval. The initial interval can be any interval that contains a root. We can choose the interval [0, 1] as our initial interval. The bisection method will then find the midpoint of the interval, evaluate the function at the midpoint, and determine which subinterval the root lies in. The algorithm will then repeat this process until it finds the root to the desired level of accuracy. For this problem, we need to find the root to two decimal places, so we will set our desired accuracy to 0.005. We will also need to define a function that takes in a value of x and returns the value of the function f(x) = x^3 - x - 4.

This can be done by finding the projection matrix, which is the matrix that, when multiplied by any vector $v$, gives the projection of $v$ onto the space spanned by the columns of $\\Phi$. The projection matrix can be obtained by computing the Gram-Schmidt process on the columns of $\\Phi$.\n\nThe Gram-Schmidt process involves normalizing the columns of $\\Phi$ and then orthogonalizing them against each other.

The projection matrix is then given by $\\Phi'\\Phi'^T$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (c) $\\Phi(\\Phi^T\\Phi)^{-1}\\Phi^T$. This is because $\\Phi^T\\Phi$ is the matrix of dot products between the columns of $\\Phi$, and its inverse is the matrix of dot products between the rows of $\\Phi'$. Multiplying $\\Phi$ by this inverse and then transposing gives the projection matrix $\\Phi'\\Phi'^T$.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* Option (a) is the inverse of $\\Phi^T\\Phi$, which is the matrix of dot products between the rows of $\\Phi$.
