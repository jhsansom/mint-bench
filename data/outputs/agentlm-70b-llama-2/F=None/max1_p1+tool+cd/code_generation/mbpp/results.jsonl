We can then use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations required to reach a state where all elements are equal. The base case is when all elements are already equal, in which case the number of operations required is 0. Otherwise, we can consider the two possible operations: adding 1 to an element, or subtracting 1 from an element. For each of these operations, we can update the histogram and recursively call the function with the updated histogram and the remaining number of operations.

In this case, the equation of the parabola is given as y = ax^2 + bx + c. I need to find the value of k. \n\nI will start by using the given parameters to find the equation of the parabola. The parameters (5, 3, 2) correspond to the coefficients a, b, and c in the equation y = ax^2 + bx + c. So, the equation of the parabola is y = 5x^2 + 3x + 2.\n\nNext, I will find the value of k by taking the negative of the coefficient of x^2 in the parabolic equation. In this case, the coefficient of x^2 is 5, so k = -5.\n\nFinally, I will use the formula y = -k to find the equation of the directrix. Plugging in k = -5, I get the equation y = 5x + b. Since the directrix is a vertical line, the value of b does not matter. Therefore, the equation of the directrix is y = 5x.\n\nTo verify my answer, I will use the given point (2, 3) to check if it lies on the directrix. If it does, then the directrix is correct.
