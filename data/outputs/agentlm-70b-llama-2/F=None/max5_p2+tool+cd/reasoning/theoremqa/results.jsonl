The face value is the amount borrowed by the borrower and is repaid to the lender at the end of the bond's maturity period. The face value is given by the product of the principal and the coupon rate. The coupon rate is the annual interest rate paid on the bond's face value. In this case, the coupon rate is 8%/year. The principal is the face value of the bond. Since the bond has 18 years to maturity, the principal is given by the product of the face value and the number of years to maturity. Let's assume the face value is $F. Then, the principal is $F \\* 18. The coupon payment is the product of the principal and the coupon rate, which is $F \\* 18 \\* 0.08. The yield is the rate of return on the bond, which is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond's future cash flows to its current market price. In this case, the yield is 9%/year. The bond's price is the present value of its future cash flows, which is the sum of the present value of each coupon payment and the present value of the face value at maturity. The present value of each coupon payment is the coupon payment divided by (1 + yield)^t, where t is the time in years until the coupon payment is made.

Therefore, $n-1$ can only divide $2^n-1$ if $n-1$ is even. Similarly, $2^n - 2$ is always even, so $n-2$ can only divide $2^n-2$ if $n-2$ is odd. Thus, we need $n-1$ to be even and $n-2$ to be odd, which means $n$ must be odd.\n\nNext, we can use the fact that $n$ divides $2^n$ if and only if $n$ divides $2^n-1$. Therefore, we only need to check if $n$ divides $2^n-1$ and if $n-1$ divides $2^n-1$.

The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. The algorithm starts by choosing a maximum and minimum value in the interval. The initial interval can be any interval that contains the root. We can choose the interval [0, 1] as our initial interval. The bisection method will then find the midpoint of the interval, evaluate the function at the midpoint, and determine which subinterval the root lies in. The algorithm will then repeat this process until it finds the root to the desired level of accuracy. For this problem, we need to find the root to two decimal places, so we will set our desired accuracy to 0.005.

We are given that phi = 2.36 eV, which is the work function of sodium. This means that the energy of the photon must be greater than or equal to phi in order to emit a photoelectron. We are also given that the kinetic energy of the photoelectron is 1.00 eV. Therefore, we can set up the equation: hf = hc/\u03bb + 1.00. To find the time it takes for the light to shine and produce a photoelectron, we can use the equation t = E/P, where t is the time, E is the energy of the photon, and P is the power of the light. We are given that the intensity of the light is 10^-8 W/m^2, which is equal to P/A, where P is the power and A is the area.
