Widely considered one of the greatest and most influential directors in cinema history, Tarkovsky's films explore spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory.Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's VGIK under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently directed his first five features in the Soviet Union: Ivan's Childhood (1962), Andrei Rublev (1966), Solaris (1972), Mirror (1975), and Stalker (1979). A number of his films from this period are ranked among the best films ever made. After years of creative conflict with state film authorities, Tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad; Nostalghia (1983) and The Sacrifice (1986) were pro\nYou have 2 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 2, "use_tool": 2, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 5735, "total_tokens": 6111, "completion_tokens": 376}, "terminate_reason": "max_propose_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 7, "prompt": "In what month is the annual documentary film festival, that is presented by the fortnightly published British journal of literary essays, held?", "reference": "march and april", "metadata": {}}}
