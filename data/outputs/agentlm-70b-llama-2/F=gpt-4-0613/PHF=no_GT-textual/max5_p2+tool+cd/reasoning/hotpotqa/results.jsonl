In The Lord of the Rings it is stated that he was originally known as Sm\u00e9agol, corrupted by the One Ring, and later named Gollum after his habit of making \"a horrible swallowing noise in his throat\".Sm\u00e9agol obtained the Ring by murdering his relative D\u00e9agol, who found it in the River Anduin. Gollum referred to the Ring as \"my precious\" or \"precious\", and it extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he \"loved and hated [the Ring], as he loved and hated himself.\" Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it.
