In this case, the speed is 30 m/s, the radius is 120 m, and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get friction = (30^2) / (120 * 9.8) = 0.273.

To prevent skidding, the sum of the normal force and the frictional force must be greater than or equal to the centripetal force required to keep the car on the curve. The centripetal force is proportional to the speed of the car and inversely proportional to the radius of the curve.

In this case, we have 8 vertices and 5 connected components, so we need to find the number of trees that would result in 5 connected components when 5 vertices are removed. We can do this by subtracting 5 from the total number of trees and then finding the result when 5 vertices are removed. The total number of trees is given by the formula T(n) = n choose 2, where n is the number of vertices. For 8 vertices, this is 8 choose 2 = 28. Subtracting 5 gives us 23, which is the number of trees when 5 vertices are removed. To find the number of labelled forests, we need to divide this by the number of ways to choose the 5 vertices that are removed. This is given by the formula C(n, k) = n choose k = n! / (k! \\* (n-k)!) = 8! / (5! \\* 3!) = 56. Therefore, the number of labelled forests is 23 / 56 = 7 / 18.

We are given that phi = 2.36 eV, which is the work function of sodium. This means that the energy of the photon must be greater than or equal to phi in order to emit a photoelectron. We are also given that the kinetic energy of the photoelectron is 1.00 eV. Therefore, we can set up the equation: hf = hc/\u03bb + 1.00. To find the time it takes for the light to shine and produce a photoelectron, we can use the equation t = E/P, where t is the time, E is the energy of the photon, and P is the power of the light. We are given that the intensity of the light is 10^-8 W/m^2, which is equal to P/A, where P is the power and A is the area. Therefore, we can set up the equation: t = (hc/\u03bb + 1.00)/(10^-8 W/m^2 \\* A).

You have successfully retrieved the birth year of Li Bai from the wiki search result. Next you should try to solve the calculus problem with the information you obtained.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Li Bai was born in 701, thus M = 701.\nTo evaluate the double integral of $(x+y)^2$ over the region $C$, where $C$ is the circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 701$, we should use polar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$, and the differential area element $dx,dy$ becomes $r,dr,d\\theta$.\n$\\int\\int_C (x+y)^2 dx,dy = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{701}} (r\\cos(\\theta) + r\\sin(\\theta))^2r,dr,d\\theta$\nLet's use the SymPy package to calculate this.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin, pi\n\nr, theta = symbols('r theta')\n\n# the integrand\nintegrand = (r*cos(theta) + r*sin(theta))**2 * r\n\n# perform the double integration\ndouble_integral = integrate(integrate(integrand, (r, 0, 701 ** 0.5)), (theta, 0, 2*pi))\nprint(double_integral)\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\nOut[2]: 245700.5*pi\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD. You successfully converted the double integral into a form that can be calculated. Now you can convert the answer to meet the output format requirement.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought> Let's round this result to three decimal places using half up rounding rule. </thought>\n<execute>\nimport math\nprint(round(245700.5*math.pi, 3))\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\n771890.886\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.
